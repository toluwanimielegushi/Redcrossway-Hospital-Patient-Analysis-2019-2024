## 🔍 Introduction

This analysis explores trends in hospital admissions, patient demographics, and department usage at Redcrossway Hospital from 2019 to 2024. Using Excel's powerful tools, we uncover meaningful patterns and produce dashboards to guide healthcare planning.

---

## 📘 Story of Data

- **Source**: Simulated hospital data structured after real-world electronic health records (EHRs).
- **Features**: Patient ID, Gender, Age, Department, Admission Date, Length of Stay, Treatment Type, etc.
- **Structure**: Each row = one patient admission; Columns = demographic & medical metrics.
- **Limitations**: No diagnosis codes, limited granular medical detail, simulated structure.

---

## 🛠️ Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned duplicates and standardized formats.
- Used Excel formulas (`IFERROR`, `ISBLANK`, `TEXT`, `DATEDIF`) for feature engineering.
- Extracted Month/Year from dates.
- Segmented data into:
  - **Dependent variables**: Admissions, Length of Stay  
  - **Independent variables**: Age Group, Gender, Department

---

## 📊 Pre-Analysis

- Female patients: **53%** of admissions.
- Departments with highest load: **Pediatrics**, **Emergency**, and **General Medicine**.
- Noticed admission peaks in Q1 each year (seasonal illnesses).

---

## 📈 In-Analysis

- Admissions rose significantly from 2021–2024 (post-pandemic recovery).
- Average Length of Stay was highest in **ICU** and **Surgery**.
- Tools Used:
  - Pivot Tables  
  - Slicers  
  - Bar/Line Charts  
  - Conditional Formatting  

---

## 📌 Post-Analysis & Insights

- **12.5% YoY increase** in admissions.
- Pediatric visits exceeded expectations.
- Seasonal spikes align with flu season.
- Elderly patients (65+) had longer hospital stays.

---


---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Scale staff levels during Q1 (Jan–Mar).
- Prioritize funding for **Emergency**, **Pediatrics**, and **ICU** departments.
- Expand elderly care services (due to longer stays).
- Integrate predictive models for monthly admission forecasts.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project shows how Excel can empower hospital administrators with actionable data insights—even from simulated or basic records. With better planning, hospitals like Redcrossway can improve patient outcomes and optimize limited resources.
